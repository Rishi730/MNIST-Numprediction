# MNIST-Numprediction
Used the MNIST dataset for predicting the number written on an image of size 28*28 pixels.
Got an introduction to the Neural networks in a GDSC study jam and tried to implement the same in this project.
Used various libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, PIL and Numpy for implementation and testing of my model.
